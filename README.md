# Development-of-Deep-Learning-Model-for-Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Histopathological-Datasets.
# Introduction
Approximately one in eight ladies worldwide suffer from Breast Cancer (BC). By identifying the cancer of the breast tissue cells, BC is diagnosed. Histopathology images taken with a microscope are processed using various algorithms and approaches using modern medical image processing systems. Medical images and pathology tools are now processed by machine learning algorithms. Since manually identifying cancer cells is a laborious process that is prone to human mistake, computer-aided mechanisms are used instead of manual pathological detection systems to get better results. This is typically accomplished in Deep Learning (DL) by first utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract features, followed by a fully connected network for classification. Since DL doesn't require prior knowledge in a related discipline, it is widely used in the medical imaging industry.

# Dataset
The datset used in this project is "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images"

# Overview
The goal is to create a deep learning model that can be used to ease the work of the pathologist so that they can check the tissue samples in greater batches and in a more efficient manner.

This requires the model to be highly accurate i.e. above 90% accuracy and have good recall in both negative and postive classes.

This illustration created "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lobules_and_ducts_of_the_breast.jpg" shows the anatomy of a healthy breast. One can see the lobules, the glands that can produce milk which flews through the milk ducts. Ductal carcinoma starts to develop in the ducts whereas lobular carcinoma has its origin in the lobules. Invasive carcinoma is able to leave its initial tissue compartment and can form metastases.
